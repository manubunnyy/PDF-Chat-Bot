## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

### 1. **Upload Files**
- Upload one or multiple PDF or image files through the Streamlit interface.

### 2. **Text Extraction**
- **PDFs**: Extract text directly from each page.
- **Images**: Apply OCR using **Tesseract** to extract text from image files.
- **OCR for PDFs**: Optionally enable OCR for embedded images in PDF files.

### 3. **Text Processing**
- The extracted text is split into smaller chunks.
- **Embeddings** (vector representations) of these text chunks are created and stored in a **FAISS** vector store for fast similarity search.

### 4. **Conversational Interface**
- Users can ask questions related to the content of the uploaded files.
- The app searches the vector store for relevant information and generates responses using the **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** model.
